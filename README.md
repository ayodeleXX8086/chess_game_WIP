Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `PieceType` constant is an object that defines different types of chess pieces: KING, QUEEN, ROOK, BISHOP, PAWN, and KNIGHT.

- The `Player` constant is an object that defines the players in the chess game: BLACK, WHITE, and EMPTY.

- The `Movement` constant is an object that defines possible movement directions: UPWARD and DOWNWARD.

- The `king`, `queen`, `rook`, `bishop`, `pawn`, and `knight` variables are HTML strings that represent the SVG icons for each corresponding chess piece. These icons are used to display the chess pieces on the chessboard.

- The `emptyBoard` variable is an empty string, possibly representing an empty chessboard square.

- The `Piece` class represents a chess piece and has the following properties:

  - `_player`: Stores the player of the piece.
  - `dimension`: Stores the dimension of the chessboard.
  - `innerHtmlElement`: Stores the HTML string representing the piece's SVG icon.
  - `_events`: Stores the events associated with the piece.
  - `_index`: Stores the index of the piece.
  - `square`: Represents the DOM element of the chessboard square associated with the piece.
  - `firstMove`: Stores a boolean indicating whether it is the piece's first move.

  The `Piece` class also has the following methods:

  - `displayAsPossiblePiece()`: Adds a CSS class to the piece's square element to highlight it as a possible move.
  - `revertToSquareColor()`: Removes the CSS class from the piece's square element to revert it to its original color.
  - `#createPiece()`: A private method that creates a DOM element for the chess piece and sets its attributes and classes based on the piece's properties.
